A software developer who values learning and growing.

I graduated from San Diego State University with honors in May 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration: Information Systems. Since graduation, I have been actively searching for full time software development jobs.

My primary interests in software development are web and mobile development. I discovered my passion for software development during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Since then, I have been working on various meaningful projects to increase my knowledge and provide benefits to users.
