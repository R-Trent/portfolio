A software developer who values learning and growing.

I graduated with honors from San Diego State University in May 2022, earning a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in Information Systems. In December 2022, I joined DIME Industries, where I have significantly contributed to several key projects.

My primary interests in software development are web and mobile development. I discovered my passion for software development during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Since then, I have been working on various meaningful projects to continue developing my skills.
